# Testing Standards

## Detected
- Framework: Vitest, Testing Library (481 test files)
- Test command: bun run test -- --run
- Testing patterns: vitest
- Test location: co-located with source

### Library Rules
- Always pass `--run` flag when invoking Vitest in CI or non-interactive contexts. Vitest defaults to watch mode, which hangs pipelines waiting for input.

## Rules
- Test behavior, not implementation. Assert on what the code returns or produces — not which internal functions it calls. Tests should survive refactoring when behavior is unchanged.
- Prefer real implementations over mocks. Mock only what you can't control: network calls, time, randomness. Every mock is a lie about how the system actually behaves.
- Cover the error path, not just the happy path. For each feature test, write at least one test for invalid input, missing data, or service failure.
- Assert on specific expected values from real inputs. `expect(status).toBe(200)` not `expect(status).toBeDefined()`. A test that passes regardless of whether the feature works catches nothing. Never write tautological tests — `expect(true).toBe(true)` proves nothing. If you can't determine the specific expected value, read the contract's `matcher`/`value` fields before falling back to a weak assertion.
- Never weaken a test to make it pass. If a test fails, fix the code or fix the expectation — never broaden assertions or catch exceptions to force green.

## Gotchas
- Vitest defaults to watch mode. Always pass `--run` in CI and non-interactive environments (e.g., `pnpm run test -- --run`).
