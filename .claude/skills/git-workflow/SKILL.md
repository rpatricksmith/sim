# Git Workflow

## Detected
- Default branch: main
- Contributors: 55
- Ana CLI: pipeline artifacts committed via `ana artifact save` with [slug] prefix. Build agent creates `{branchPrefix}{slug}` branches (read `branchPrefix` from `.ana/ana.json`, default `feature/`). Co-author from ana.json.

## Rules
- Commit each logical change separately. Don't batch unrelated changes into one commit.
- Write commit messages that explain what changed and why: `feat: add input validation to signup` not `update files`.
- Stage specific files for each commit. Avoid `git add .` or `git add -A` — review what you're committing.
