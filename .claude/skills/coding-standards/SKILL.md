# Coding Standards

## Detected
- Language: TypeScript with Next.js (7422 source files)
- Functions: camelCase (75%, 1255 sampled)
- Classes: PascalCase (71%)
- Files: kebab-case (76%, 750 sampled)
- Imports: relative (100%)
- Indentation: spaces, 2 wide
- Error handling: exceptions (nextjs)
- Data fetching: react-query
- State management: zustand (incidental)
- Form handling: react-hook-form
- UI: shadcn/ui (Tailwind)

### Library Rules
- All local imports use `.js` extensions (`import { foo } from "./bar.js"`). TypeScript compiles without them but ESM resolution crashes at runtime.
- Use `import type` for type-only imports, separate from value imports. Prevents runtime imports of pure types.
- Default to Server Components. Only add `"use client"` when the component needs browser APIs, event handlers, or useState/useEffect. Data fetching belongs in Server Components — no useEffect waterfalls.

## Rules
- Prefer named exports. Default exports only where the framework requires them (e.g., Next.js pages, layouts).
- Use path aliases from tsconfig when configured. Relative imports: never deeper than two levels.
- Avoid `any` — use `unknown` and narrow with type guards. `any` is acceptable only for untyped third-party boundaries. Define an interface for complex types — don't escape the type system.
- Every catch block must do something deliberate: re-throw, return a typed error, or log with context. Empty catch blocks are never acceptable. Intentional graceful degradation — catching a failure and continuing with a fallback — is fine when the degradation is logged and observable.
- Never hardcode API keys, secrets, database URLs, or credentials. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
- Avoid disabling lint rules inline. When necessary, add a comment explaining why the disable is required.
- Explicit return types on all exported functions. Internal helpers can use inference.

## Gotchas
- Next.js App Router components are Server Components by default. Add `'use client'` only when the component needs browser APIs, event handlers, or React hooks like useState/useEffect.
